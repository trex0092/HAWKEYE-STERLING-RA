# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the application follows the `APP_VERSION` constant in [`index.html`](index.html).
Release tags and notes are also generated automatically by the
[Auto Release workflow](.github/workflows/auto-release.yml) on every version
bump merged to `main`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Progressive Web App (offline-capable):** a `manifest.webmanifest`, a
  network-first [service worker](sw.js) that precaches only the static app shell
  (never API responses or on-device risk data), and dependency-free PNG icons
  generated from the SVG (`scripts/gen-icons.mjs`). The three command-center
  screens install and run offline without changing the privacy posture.
- **Batch screening:** paste or upload a CSV of counterparties and score the
  whole list against the risk engine in one pass, exporting the results as CSV
  (in-app modal; pure helpers `batchParseCsv`/`scoreBatch`/`batchToCsv`).
- **UBO / ownership graph:** the principals field renders an at-a-glance
  beneficial-owner / controller / director graph in the sidebar.
- **Review scheduler:** the register summarises upcoming and overdue reviews
  (overdue flagged red, due-within-a-month amber) with at-a-glance counts.
- **Bilingual UI (English / العربية):** a language toggle with full RTL support
  across all three screens and JS-rendered content, persisted in `localStorage`
  (`hsra.lang`). Long-form legal/narrative report text intentionally stays
  English-only (the authoritative language for filed records) — see
  [`docs/i18n-ar-legal-review.md`](docs/i18n-ar-legal-review.md).
- **GLEIF LEI verification (opt-in):** confirm an organisation's Legal Entity
  Identifier, jurisdiction and registration status against the free GLEIF API
  (ISO 17442 / 7064 MOD 97-10 checksum; `scripts/lei-check.mjs`). A verification
  signal, never a risk hit — a non-match is "no LEI corroboration", not assurance.
- **Threat-intelligence enrichment (opt-in):** screen a subject against a
  STIX 2.1 bundle (OpenCTI / MISP / TAXII export) of threat-actors, intrusion-sets
  and identities (`scripts/threat-intel.mjs`); supplementary "must verify", never
  an authoritative designation.
- **Switzerland (SECO) + Australia (DFAT) sanctions sources:** the daily customer
  screen now covers SECO's "Gesamtliste" XML and Australia's DFAT Consolidated
  List. DFAT is published only as `.xlsx`, so the engine gained a dependency-free
  XLSX reader (ZIP + sharedStrings + worksheet walk via `node:zlib`) in
  `scripts/sanctions-match.mjs`. Both degrade visibly on any fetch/layout change —
  never a silent all-clear.
- **Cybersecurity Skills plugin:** pre-registers the Apache-2.0
  [Anthropic Cybersecurity Skills](https://github.com/mukul975/Anthropic-Cybersecurity-Skills)
  library as a Claude Code plugin ([`.claude/settings.json`](.claude/settings.json));
  see [`docs/cybersecurity-skills.md`](docs/cybersecurity-skills.md) and the
  MITRE F3 typology mapping in [`docs/fraud-f3-mapping.md`](docs/fraud-f3-mapping.md).
- **Repository hardening (supply chain):** every GitHub Action is now pinned to a
  verified commit SHA (with a `# vX` comment so Dependabot still tracks updates);
  added an [OpenSSF Scorecard](.github/workflows/scorecard.yml) workflow and a
  `step-security/harden-runner` egress audit on all secret-bearing workflows.
- **Community-health files:** `LICENSE` (proprietary), `SECURITY.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `CITATION.cff`,
  `.github/CODEOWNERS`, a pull-request template, and issue templates
  (bug, feature, compliance review).

### Changed

- Dependabot now groups GitHub Actions updates into a single weekly PR.
- `codeql.yml` gained an explicit top-level least-privilege `permissions` block.
